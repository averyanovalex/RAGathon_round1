# Overview

This repository contains a collection of solutions to the [enterprise-rag-challenge](https://github.com/trustbit/enterprise-rag-challenge/).

# The Challenge

In a nutshell, the [enterprise-rag-challenge](https://github.com/trustbit/enterprise-rag-challenge/) is about building a piece of software that answers questions like

> How much did the company "Accuray Incorporated" spend on risk management in 2022?

accurately. The data containing the basic factual information is provided in unstructured PDFs. As such, the expectation is that
solutions will use *large language models (LLMs)* in some form to solve the challenge - hence the term *RAG* (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
in its name.

# The Solutions 

These solutions in this repository were developed quite quickly - within 2 work days - and should therefore be viewed as proof-of-concept
rather than ready-for-production. And as expected, each solution used LLMs in some way, but it turned out that *how* the LLMs are used
differ quite a bit across the solutions.

Thus, we expect this repository to be most interesting to developers looking for inspiration on possible approaches to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Each directory in this repository represents a solution. Each solution is self-contained; refer to the included READMEs for
more information.

Happy Browsing!
