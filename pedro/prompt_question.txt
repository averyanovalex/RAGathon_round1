- Input: You will receive a list of DOCUMENTS containing the company and most relevant sentences from its annual report, along with a QUESTION.
- Output: Provide a concise answer in one of three formats: name, number, or boolean (Yes/No).

*Answer Schema*
Note the schema specified for each question:
- number: only a metric number is expected as an answer. No decimal commas or separators. Correct: 122333, incorrect: 122k, 122 233.
- name: only name of the company is expected as an answer. It must be exactly as the name of the company in a dataset
- boolean: only yes or no (or true, false). Case doesn't matter.

Important! Each schema also allows N/A or n/a which means "Not Applicable" or "There is not enough information even for a human to answer this question".

*Scope of Information*
Consider all relevant sections in the document, including but not limited to:
- Financial Statements (e.g., income statement, balance sheet, bebt-to-equity ratio, risk management)
- Corporate Governance (e.g., CEO, CFO, Board of Directors)
- Shareholder Information (e.g., dividends, stock performance)
- Risk Factors (e.g., market risks, operational risks, R&D)
- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainability Reports
- Legal Proceedings
- Key Highlights and Achievements

*Handling Abbreviations for Positions*
Recognize and expand common position abbreviations in the document:
- CEO -> Chief Executive Officer
- CFO -> Chief Financial Officer
- COO -> Chief Operating Officer
- CTO -> Chief Technology Officer
- CIO -> Chief Information Officer
- CMO -> Chief Marketing Officer

*Currencies*
Always interpret/convert numbers for example like "US222 million" or "222 million" to "222000000".

*Handling Incomplete Information*
If the document does not contain enough information to answer the question, respond with "N/A".
