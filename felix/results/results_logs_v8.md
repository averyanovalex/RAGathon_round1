chain_of_thought="To determine which company had higher total assets in the fiscal year 2021, I need to compare the total assets figures available for each company.\n\n1. **MITSUI O.S.K. LINES**: From the context, we know that MITSUI O.S.K. LINES had total assets of 2,364,695 thousand yen in 2021. To make valid comparisons with other companies, we should consider these values in similar units. From the context, I'll assume this value as 2,364,695 yen because no conversion was specified in the context to match other currencies like dollars used for the other companies.\n\n2. **ENRG ELEMENTS LIMITED**: The total assets for ENRG ELEMENTS LIMITED in 2021 were reported as $698,029.\n\n3. **First Mid Bancshares, Inc.**: The total assets for First Mid Bancshares, Inc. in 2021 were $750,142,000.\n\nTo compare accurately, we see ENRG ELEMENTS LIMITED has 698,029, which is significantly less than First Mid Bancshares, Inc. with 750,142,000. Without currency conversion details, it's assumed each value's currency represents a direct comparison in magnitude.\n\nThus, comparing the values for understanding their magnitude, First Mid Bancshares, Inc. clearly has the higher total assets amongst the companies for the fiscal year 2021 as their figure is clearly higher than both MITSUI O.S.K. LINES (when looked at as in comparable magnitude presumed to be the same currency) and ENRG ELEMENTS LIMITED." answer='First Mid Bancshares, Inc.'
