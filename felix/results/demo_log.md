        chain_of_thought='Free cash flow can be calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.\n\n1. Operating cash flow for 2021 is provided as $554,151,000.\n2. Capital expenditures for 2021, based on additions to property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, is $144,403,000.\n\nThe formula for free cash flow is:\nFree Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures\n\nNumerically:\nFree Cash Flow = $554,151,000 - $144,403,000 = $409,748,000.',

        chain_of_thought="To find TransUnion's free cash flow for the fiscal year 2021, I will start by identifying the operating cash flow and capital expenditures from the consolidated statements of cash flows. The free cash flow can be computed as:\n\nFree Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures\n\nFrom the provided context:\n- Operating Cash Flow for 2021 is $808.3 million.\n- Capital Expenditures for 2021 is $224.2 million.\n\nUsing these figures, the free cash flow is calculated as:\n\n808.3 (Operating Cash Flow) - 224.2 (Capital Expenditures) = 584.1 million.",

### ASKING COMPANY EXPERT: First Mid Bancshares, Inc.
    AnswerEvent(
        chain_of_thought="The context provides cash flow details for First Mid Bancshares, Inc. for the fiscal year 2021. The net cash provided by operating activities is given as $(155,585)$. However, the context does not provide specific details on capital expenditures (CapEx) directly.\n\nTypically, CapEx can be found in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. From the context, in investing activities, there's no specific mention of amounts explicitly labeled as capital expenditures, so we must assume that any acquisition-related net cash outflows are not related to CapEx as defined for determining free cash flow.\n\nThus, based on the given information, free cash flow (FCF) cannot be precisely determined due to insufficient details on the CapEx for 2021. Therefore, it's concluded that the free cash flow is not directly computable from the provided information.",
