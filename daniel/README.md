# Daniel's Approach

## Setup

Create a `.env` file containing an OpenAI API key. Example:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-thisisafakeapikey
```

Install requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the `samples` directory and the file `dataset.csv` from the hackathon repo into this directory.
